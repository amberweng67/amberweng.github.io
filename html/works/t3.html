            Fortunately, I had a chance to participate in this consultant project as a UX designer. Mentored by a senior UX designer, I produced some deliverables and presented these to stakeholders. They helped me to grow fast as a professional designer and learned a lot about how to collaborate as a team.

            <p>
              The idea of getting into a stranger's unmarked car was unheard of even a decade ago. Today, ride-sharing platforms are tremendously popular: Uber, for example, provides millions of rides worldwide each day. However that transition happened without a lot of oversight or regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In China, the ride-sharing industry faced strong criticism, since 2018, 2 riders reportedly raped and murdered at the hands of their drivers in less than 100 days. These two murders and some sexually assault cases hit ride-sharing business and reputation. <span class="highlight highlight-walker">Passengers are worried that the ride-sharing companies ignore riders safety problem to pursue scale and rapid growth.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subgroup text-content">
          <h4 id="problem">Problem & Principles</h4>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight highlight-walker">Safety problem is every ride-share company's problem. </span>Today, some safety features have been introduced which include ID test for drivers and safety center for users. But these are far from enough to <span class="highlight highlight-walker">gain riders trust and ensure the safety of passengers</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to better understand and reduce this problem, we conducted this project. The T3 Go experience was built with safety in mind. <span class="highlight highlight-walker">Through designing incident prevention tools, customized rating system, clear drivers information, and elevated security hardware-app connection, we’re dedicated to helping riders move safely</span> and focus on what matters most.
          </p>
          <p class="work-text">
            Then we decided three keywords to guide our design work:

          <div class="subgroup">
              <h4 id="whatdidtheysay">What did they say?</h4>
              <p>
                Though we got some data and metrics from desk research, we decided to make 15 <span class="highlight highlight-walker">interviews</span> with riders and drivers. We wanted to explore who were our users, how they were using ride-sharing app, and what did they concern about safety and trust problems during their whole riding experiences. I talked with passengers and asked questions like "What's your favorite part of ride-sharing app?” “<span class="highlight highlight-walker">What does safety and trust mean to you?</span>” 
              </p>
              <p>
                The team conducted an <span class="highlight highlight-walker">affinity diagramming</span> session after the interview. We worked together to group all of the sticky notes created into associative groups, to identify key patterns, in terms of problems found, user attitudes as well as behaviors.
              </p>
              <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/Affinity diagram@2x.png" alt="">
              <p>
                The patterns presented in the affinity diagram allowed us to identify the dominant problems and concerns.  In other words, what do they care about when we are talking about safety and trust.

              <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/key findings.png" alt="">
              <p>
                After summarizing research results and identifying multiple behavioral variables, I create the primary personas to guide my design process.

          <p>
            Then I was wondering <span class="highlight highlight-walker">"What design opportunities do we have?"</span> “How can we help passenger ride with trust and safety?” I developed a <span class="highlight highlight-walker">user journey</span> with typical use cases and listed all the key information in each step to help me gain a better understanding.

              Moving into the design phase of the project, each team member went away to individually conceptualize and sketch some ideas for solutions to the problems raised throughout the research phase. As a team, we then discussed each other’s proposals, identifying the promising qualities that could be taken forward from each design. After collaborating to sketch out a solution based on the qualities identified, we then created a <span class="highlight highlight-walker">wireframe</span>.
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/Lo-fi white.png" alt="">

            <h4 id="designAlternatives">Design alternatives</h4>
            <p>
              Through the design process, I had lots of opportunities to get feedback not only from the design team but also from the PMs. <span class="highlight highlight-walker">Iteration</span> after iteration was made to distill our MVP down to a very lightweight, bare-minimum version. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I categorized all types of information into 3 sections to ensure the highthighest safety and security standards: <span class="highlight highlight-walker">before the ride, during the ride, and after the ride.</span> Here are some representative screens from each section that have either been discarded or planned for a later release.
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/Iteration1.png" alt="">
            <p>
              In this one, I highlighted <span class="highlight highlight-walker">plate number, vehicle model and color as</span> they were the most vital content that passengers would use for recognizing the car and driver. Also, by putting the most frequently used 3 features on the bottom, <span class="highlight highlight-walker">contact driver, cancel ride, and share trip,</span> I make the info card clearer and shorter.  
            </p>
            <p>            
              Meanwhile, Card-based design can gather various pieces of information to form one coherent piece of content and it’s intuitive for users to understand.
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/Iteration 2.png" alt="">
            <p>            
              Come back to the goal that we wanted to gain riders trust and ensure the safety of passengers, the way we were showing the ride card was inefficient. By structuring the sections in a vertical stack, the most wanted information (<span class="highlight highlight-walker">arrival time and destination</span>) was placed on the top of the ride card. To help riders easily control their trips, these 3 features - <span class="highlight highlight-walker">call police, share trip and change destination</span> were moved to the top as well.
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin" src="../../assets/pics/t3/Iteration 3.png" alt="">
            <p>            
              The previous design divided rating to 3 sections - driver, app, and vehicle. Users felt this required too much effort. Instead, we utilized <span class="highlight highlight-walker">general rating and existing tags</span> (compliments or complaints) as a default mechanism to help users provide their feedback. With only 3-4 clicks, we maximized output.  
            </p>
            <p>            
              We understand that sometimes the drivers make riders feel unsafe or annoyed, so we provide an opportunity for riders to <span class="highlight highlight-walker">blacklist</span> these drivers. Next time, the system will avoid assigning this driver to you
