          Fortunately, I had a chance to participate in this consultant project
          as a UX designer. Mentored by a senior UX designer, I produced some
          deliverables and presented these to stakeholders. They helped me to
          grow fast as a professional designer and learned a lot about how to
          collaborate as a team.

        <h4 id="context">Context</h4>
        <p>
          The idea of getting into a stranger's unmarked car was unheard of even
          a decade ago. Today, ride-sharing platforms are tremendously popular:
          Uber, for example, provides millions of rides worldwide each day.
          However that transition happened without a lot of oversight or
          regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In China, the ride-sharing industry faced strong criticism, since
          2018, 2 riders reportedly raped and murdered at the hands of their
          drivers in less than 100 days. These two murders and some sexually
          assault cases hit ride-sharing business and reputation.
          <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
            >Passengers are worried that the ride-sharing companies ignore
            riders safety problem to pursue scale and rapid growth.</span
          >
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subgroup text-content">
        <h4 id="problem">Problem & Principles</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
            >Safety problem is every ride-share company's problem. </span
          >Today, some safety features have been introduced which include ID
          test for drivers and safety center for users. But these are far from
          enough to
          <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
            >gain riders trust and ensure the safety of passengers</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to better understand and reduce this problem, we conducted
          this project. The T3 Go experience was built with safety in mind.
          <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
            >Through designing incident prevention tools, customized rating
            system, clear drivers information, and elevated security

          >
          and focus on what matters most.
        </p>
        <p class="work-text">
          Then we decided three keywords to guide our design work:

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <hr class="hr-t3" />
        <div class="row">
          <div class="subgroup">
            <h4 id="whatdidtheysay">What did they say?</h4>
            <p>
              Though we got some data and metrics from desk research, we decided
              to make 15
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3">interviews</span>
              with riders and drivers. We wanted to explore who were our users,
              how they were using ride-sharing app, and what did they concern
              about safety and trust problems during their whole riding
              experiences. I talked with passengers and asked questions like
              "What's your favorite part of ride-sharing app?” “<span
                class="highlight highlight-t3"
                >What does safety and trust mean to you?</span
              >”
            </p>
            <p>
              The team conducted an
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3">affinity diagramming</span>
              session after the interview. We worked together to group all of
              the sticky notes created into associative groups, to identify key
              patterns, in terms of problems found, user attitudes as well as
              behaviors.

              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The patterns presented in the affinity diagram allowed us to
              identify the dominant problems and concerns. In other words, what
              do they care about when we are talking about safety and trust.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              After summarizing research results and identifying multiple
              behavioral variables, I create the primary personas to guide my
              design process.

          <p>
            Then I was wondering

              >"What design opportunities do we have?"</span
            >
            “How can we help passenger ride with trust and safety?” I developed
            a
            <span class="highlight highlight-t3">user journey</span>
            with typical use cases and listed all the key information in each

              Moving into the design phase of the project, each team member went
              away to individually conceptualize and sketch some ideas for
              solutions to the problems raised throughout the research phase. As
              a team, we then discussed each other’s proposals, identifying the
              promising qualities that could be taken forward from each design.
              After collaborating to sketch out a solution based on the
              qualities identified, we then created a
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3">wireframe</span>.

              <span class="highlight highlight-t3">Iteration</span>

              Here are some representative screens from each section that have

              In this one, I highlighted

              >
              they were the most vital content that passengers would use for
              recognizing the car and driver. Also, by putting the most
              frequently used 3 features on the bottom,
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
                >contact driver, cancel ride, and share trip,</span
              >
              I make the info card clearer and shorter.

              Meanwhile, Card-based design can gather various pieces of
              information to form one coherent piece of content and it’s
              intuitive for users to understand.

              Come back to the goal that we wanted to gain riders trust and
              ensure the safety of passengers, the way we were showing the ride
              card was inefficient. By structuring the sections in a vertical
              stack, the most wanted information (<span
                class="highlight highlight-t3"
                >arrival time and destination</span
              >) was placed on the top of the ride card. To help riders easily
              control their trips, these 3 features -
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
                >call police, share trip and change destination</span
              >
              were moved to the top as well.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-responsive full-img bottom-margin"
              src="../../assets/works/t3/Iteration 3.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The previous design divided rating to 3 sections - driver, app,
              and vehicle. Users felt this required too much effort. Instead, we
              utilized
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3"
                >general rating and existing tags</span
              >
              (compliments or complaints) as a default mechanism to help users
              provide their feedback. With only 3-4 clicks, we maximized output.
            </p>
            <p>
              We understand that sometimes the drivers make riders feel unsafe
              or annoyed, so we provide an opportunity for riders to
              <span class="highlight highlight-t3">blacklist</span>
              these drivers. Next time, the system will avoid assigning this
              driver to you

                      for a very long time. If we notice anything out of the

                      <span class="highlight highlight-t3">urgent alert</span>
                      to you and you can also provide feedback to us if the
                      alert is not accurate.

                      You can check details about this alert or active
                      protection system. When you tap “active”, we will
                      <span class="highlight highlight-t3"

                    <li>
                      From 11 PM to 5 AM, the app displays a floating banner to
                      remind that you are riding at late night, please keep
                      alert.

                    <li>
                      Arrival time and destination are placed on the top of the

                    <li>
                      You can use the in-app emergency button to call the police
                      to get help if you need it. The app displays your location
                      and trip details, so you can quickly share them with the
                      police dispatcher or your family and friends.

                      Upon the completion of a ride, we use witty remarks to
                      encourage users to provide ratings and comments.

                    <li>
                      If positive, you proceed to recognize and

                        >select the positive labels of the ride.</span
                      >
                      The process of leaving a negative rating for a ride works
                      much in the same way as when leaving a positive rating.
                      You are also able to add your
                      <span class="highlight highlight-t3">own critique</span>,
                      if not available in the predefined list.

                    <li>
                      You now have the option to

                        >‘block’ a driver</span
                      >, and you will not match with that driver again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Every piece of feedback is valuable to both the driver for
                      performance improvement, and to T3 Go as a company. The
                      selections in both positive and negative help to build up
                      the profile of the driver, influencing the match system.

          <p>
            From this project, I learned about the importance of gathering
            requirements from the development team and stakeholders. But
            sometimes what stakeholders want doesn’t mean anybody else will. We
            need to ground stakeholders and team in reality with empirical
            evidence. We must turn assumptions into facts.

          <h4 id="runmeetings">Run meetings efficiently</h4>
          <p>
            When I was doing school projects, meetings usually went longer than
            expected. In the industry, especially for a remote team, with
            everyone’s busy schedules, we had to plan and facilitate meetings
            efficiently. Setting a clear goal for each meeting, keeping the
            agenda on the whiteboard to put everyone on the same page would be
            very helpful.
