<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
The University Settlement Society of New York is an American organization which provides educational and social services to immigrants and low-income families. I was a research and social work intern to provide case management and psychosocial interventions to children. I administered research protocols for study, examining the impact of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) on undocumented and immigrant students.

<div class="portfolio-subtitle"><h4>RESEARCH</h4></div>
<p class="portfolio-p">It’s not surprising that many undocumented and immigrant students struggle to adjust to the new surroundings, since these students’ experiences often create special learning needs. They may be dealing with the trauma of leaving a country or being separated from family. This can cause stress, anxiety, and the inability to form meaningful relationships with peers or educators.

Our social research team focused on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), trying to figure out how SEL help support these students and teachers alike, and promote positive outcomes for both.

</h4></div>
<p class="portfolio-p">For a more holistic understanding of SEL’s impact on students and educators, I spent a lot of time buried in the academic research and literature.

“ According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there are roughly 4.6 million English language learner students in the USA…………….”</p>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle"><h4>INTERVIEWS</h4></div>
<p class="portfolio-p">Meanwhile, we recruited, scheduled, and screened participants for studies, including multi- disciplinary interventions. We interviewed them at school or home, assisted them completed open-text survey and then observed them for about an hour.
</p>
<p class="portfolio-p">After the interview, I generated the dialogue with observation, analysis, and brief intervention. Please check my sample process recordings below.

<div class="portfolio-subtitle"><h4>INTERVENTIONS</h4></div>
<p class="portfolio-p">In order to make undocumented and immigrant students become more engaged, motivated, and integrated into American culture, we provide a series of interventions to improve social and emotional skills.
<div class="portfolio-p"> 
<ul>
	<li>After School Services</li>
	<li>Parenting Workshop </li>
	<li>Mental Health counseling</li>
	<li>English Class				</li>
	<li>Behavior therapy	</li>
</ul>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle"><h4>OUTCOMES</h4></div>
<p class="portfolio-p">English Language Learners and immigrant students face unique challenges. SEL is effective for supporting them. SEL can help these students become more engaged, build stronger relationships, and navigate the challenges of learning new cultural norms.
