<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
Selfhelp is one of the largest and most respected not-for-profit human service agencies in the New York metropolitan area, with 27 sites offering programs throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Nassau County and Westchester. 
</p>
<p class="portfolio-p">
I worked at a NYS Medicaid Program to offer comprehensive case management services for Medicaid patients at high-risk to reduce 30-day hospital readmission. 
</p>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle">
<h4>DATA ANALYSIS</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
We received daily discharged patientsâ€™ data from NYS Medicaid Office. I was in charge to filter and clean the data by using advanced Excel skills.

<p class="portfolio-p portfolio-afterpic">
Meanwhile, we use SPSS to monitor patient medical condition and defined patients who would be at high-risk.
</p>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle">
<h4>INTERVIEWS</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
After the data analysis, we had the list of patients who met our requirement of measurements. Then we reached out these patients and caregivers to conduct 30-day follow up. We provided at least 4 follow up phone calls and 1 in-home interview to each patient.     
</p>
<p class="portfolio-p">
I interviewed 300+ Medicaid patients quarterly on field trips to provide cognitive behavioral therapy and social assistance. I also developed case management through a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy in the interview.   
</p>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle">
<h4>INTERVENTIONS</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
Because of comprehensive assessment of patient, we developed specific plans to help patients live with dignity and independence and avoid 30-day hospital readmission.   
</p>
<p class="portfolio-p">
I helped patients and their families navigate the maze of health care and residential options, monitor and support ongoing care, and prepare for future care needs. Here are some Interventions:  
</p>
<div class="portfolio-p"> 
<ul>
<li>Health insurance information</li>
<li>Screening for entitlements and benefits </li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Home-delivered meals</li>
<li>Home care</li>
<li>Care coordination</li>
<li>Caregiver support</li>
</ul>

<h4>REPORT</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
Based on the psychosocial assessments and actionable development plans, I wrote and managed the case notes and reports to to various levels of leadership. Please check the case vignette below:

</div>

<div class="portfolio-subtitle">
<h4>OUTCOME</h4>
</div>
<p class="portfolio-p">
Case management was provided in-home or by telephone within 30 days post-discharge to improve transitions between hospital and home, enhance communications between community and hospital, increase access to and use of community based Long Term Services & Supports, and reduce hospital re-admissions.
</p>
<p class="portfolio-p">
We were glad to report that we reduced 30-day readmission rate by 27.6% for recently discharged Medicaid patients through psychosocial interventions.
